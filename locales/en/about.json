  "description": "I am a father of three and live in the Basque Country, southwest of France. It's a beautiful land and culture that inspire me everyday in my work. Since the beginning of my programming journey in 2017, I worked as head of IT for the University of Pau's academic libraries. I specialized in JavaScript and TypeScript to build applications everybody can use simply in their browser, with no installation needed. I built apps that focus on very different topics like providing business intelligence, automating repetitive tasks, helping students with administrative procedures. In 2023, I gratuaded at <i>la Capsule</i> bootcamp, worked on board.lease, a peer to peer surfoard renting mobile-first website. I am currently open to work."
